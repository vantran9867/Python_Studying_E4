# E4_coronavirus:
In this exercise, the learner created a graph which
compares the trends of daily coronavirus cases between Australia and Vietnam. 

The graph was based on the daily COVID-19 cases recorded in Australia and 
Vietnam from 22/1/2020 to 22/2/2021.

In this project, the learner practiced plotting graphs on matplotlib using the 
JSON data. The "Date" format was researched and practiced.

Pipnv was installed for the project.
